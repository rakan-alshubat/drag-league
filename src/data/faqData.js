                question: "What are bonus categories?",
                answer: "Bonus categories are special prediction challenges you can add to your league. They can be queen-based (like Miss Congeniality), number-based (like counting how many times something happens), or yes/no questions about the season."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I change league settings after creation?",
                answer: "League admins can modify certain settings like deadlines and privacy options. However, core settings like the number of queens and scoring rules are locked once the league starts."

            {
                question: "What is the privacy setting?",
                answer: "Privacy determines whether other players can see your rankings. In private leagues, only you and the admin can view your predictions. In public leagues, all participants can see everyone's rankings."

                question: "How does scoring work?",
                answer: "You earn points based on how accurately you predict the elimination order. Each queen you rank correctly in their final placement position earns you the points you assigned to that spot. Bonus categories can add extra points!"

            {
                question: "When do I submit my rankings?",
                answer: "You must submit your initial rankings before the league deadline (usually before the season starts). The admin can set this deadline when creating the league."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I change my rankings after submitting?",
                answer: "You can update your rankings before the league deadline passes. Once the deadline hits, rankings are locked and the competition begins!"
            },
            {
                question: "What happens if I don't submit by the deadline?",
                answer: "If you miss the deadline, you won't be able to participate in that season's competition. Make sure to submit your predictions in time!"

            {
                question: "How do weekly deadlines work?",
                answer: "The league admin sets a weekly deadline (typically before each episode airs). Once the deadline passes, it automatically resets to the following week, and submissions are locked."
            },
            {
                question: "Do weekly submissions affect my score?",
                answer: "Weekly submissions are tracked for fun and bragging rights! Your main score comes from your initial elimination order predictions and bonus categories."

                question: "Why can't I see my league updates in real-time?",
